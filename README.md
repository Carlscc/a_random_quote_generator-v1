### Create an array of JS objects to hold the data for the quotes:
Each quote should have the following properties:
- [x] A `quote` property which contains a string: the text of the quote to display on the page.
- [x] A `source` property which contains a string identifying the creator of the quote.
- [x] At least one `citation` property which contains a string identifying the publication the quote appears in.
- [x] At least one `year` property which contains a number identifying the date of the quote.

### Create a function named `getRandomQuote`:
- [x] selects a random quote object from the quotes array
- [x] returns the randomly selected quote objects

### Create a function named `printQuote`:
- [x] `printQuote` calls the `getRandomQuote` function and stores the returned quote object in a variable.
- [x] `printQuote` constructs a string using the different properties of the quote object.
- [x] `printQuote` contains if statements if the quotes have citation and year properties.
- [x] `printQuote` displays the final HTML string to the page. 

### Extra Credit

- [x] Add more properties to the quote object. For example, a tags property could include a list of "tags" like -- "humor", "business", "politics" -- to categorize each quote.
- [x] Change the background color of the page, when the 'Show another quote' button is clicked.
- [x] Refresh the quote after a set amount of time. For example, every 30 seconds, make a new quote appear.
